      My name is Kumaresh PV from Tamil Nadu, India. During my tenure as a
      Programmer Analyst at Cognizant, I worked on a training project using the
      MERN stack to build a responsive website for student administration in
      schools. A key feature of the project was the integration of a live chat
      function using Socket.IO with React libraries. Currently, I am in second year of my masters program.
